# Intro
My final project for the WEB233 class at Rock Valley College. The class mostly teaches you about JavaScript and all of the basics with the code. Note that this code is not mean't to be edited or used for any other use and I hold all copyright permissions with it. You can download in on your device to use to look at the site but don't reuse this please. 
# Features
1. All files written in HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.
2. Source images used from manufacture websites for computers along with the prices and specs of the unit for sale.
3. JavaScript plugins such as jQuery, jQueryUI, Leaflet, bxSlider and a GitHub repo used for the States selection on contact form.
4. Working shopping cart basing off a script provided in the class, working product page, order confirmation screen, submitable form on Contact Us and more scripts for website functionality.
# Project Timeframe
This website took about a month to complete in class with three checkpoints along the way to make sure everyone is progressing to get the project done.
# Summary
Overall this project is a huge monument in my web development journy featuring modern easy to use UI and attractive styling. I'm very proud of this project for what it is and may update in the future when I learn more tricks with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
